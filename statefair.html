                The Minnesota State Fair is another major event that takes place yearly and brings people together
                from every corner of the state. Each year it attracts on average 2 million people many of which are from out of state.
                The fair is actually is the largest in the country by average daily attendance and second-largest in the country by total
                attendance second only to Texas' which runs twice as long. 
                Much like the Mall of America, be sure to plan to spend a long time there exploring the more than
                300 food vendors and countless rides and attractions! Like the Mall of America below we are going to list some of the
                more prominent spots within the fairgrounds that we believe are top on the priority list to see! We also are going to include
                an inside look at what it's like to go in the space tower and be able to look over much of Hennepin County as well as 
                a mouth watering up close and personal look at the most famous treat the fair has to offer being Sweet Martha's Cookies!
                Below will also include a chart with some special performances the fair will also be hosting that you won't want to miss!
                Be sure to make it in for at least some of the 12 days of the best fun Minnesota has to offer!
